## Real-time Drowsiness Detection Demo

In this video, we showcase the real-time drowsiness detection system implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Watch how our system monitors a person's eyes in real-time and raises an alert when signs of drowsiness are detected. This demo provides a visual demonstration of the system's capabilities, including its ability to work with both webcam and video input sources. See how our technology can help prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue or inattentiveness.
